# Social Scan

## Project overview: 
Social Scan is a webapp that generates a heatmap to display the density of a specific search term in tweets within a specific area and time period, as determined by the user's search.

## Technologies: 
In order to index Tweets and process queries to get results, Social Scan uses ElasticSearch on the server side. To construct a microservice with RESTful APIs, it also uses the FastAPI framework. The client-side heatmap is created using the Javascript Leaflet library.
